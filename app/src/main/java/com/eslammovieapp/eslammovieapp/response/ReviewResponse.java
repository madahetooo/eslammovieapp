Well, the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise echoes this same sentiment, with flashy fifty-something star Tom Cruise still carrying that boyish exuberance that never seems to miss a beat, and can breathe a sigh of relief because the latest chapter will not disappoint in its adventurous, adrenaline-rushing skin. Yes, Cruise is back as IMF super spy stud Ethan Hunt in writer-director Christopher McQuarrie\u2019s power-surging \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019. Notoriously slick, ambitious, wildly impish and vastly intriguing, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 incorporates superb direction, writing and, of course, its no-nonsense dosage of non-stop shenanigans to fuel the audience\u2019s escapist palates.\r\n\r\nIn actuality, \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 is a hyper and hip throwback to the original blueprint for this kinetic movie series that took viewers by storm when it first premiered back in 1996. The minor outcry for the box office sensation that was the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big screen offering back in the late 90s was quite understandable since it did not seem to stay entirely true to the iconic 60s television series thus being dismissed as a volt-driven vanity piece for the high-strutting Cruise. Still, the cinematic \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 experience did not peter out but steadily built a devoted fan base that wanted to endure the high-flying hedonism of Cruise\u2019s espionage daredevil Hunt and his band of cunning cohorts. It is definitely safe to say that the stellar \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has delivered a bang for its buck in a summertime cinema hunger that thrives for such sleek, innovative spy thrillers that charm more than harm. Maybe \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 will not let anyone forget the exploits of the legendary James Bond spy capers anytime soon but hey\u2026Cruise\u2019s hotshot Hunt has a colorfully distinctive way of promoting his \u2018shaken, not stirred\u2019 moments as well.\r\n\r\nSo how did the collaboration of filmmaker McQuarrie and his chance-taking lead Cruise give \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 its deliciously sinister, overactive pulse? The fact that the overzealous stuntwork (much of it performed by Cruise with daring enthusiasm) is imaginative and the story feels smart and clever certainly has a lot to do with the magnetic appeal of \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019. Hey, the TV advertisements even give a generous peek into the pulsating platitudes that the MI universe will swallow with robust anticipation. Watch IMF agent Hunt hang on to a speedy airplane with his dear life in the balance. Watch IMF agent Hunt jump into a deadly spiral of a waterfall. Watch IMF agent Hunt race a piercingly fast motorcycle (or car\u2026take your pick) and enjoy the road raging carnage with poetic prominence. Okay\u2026you get the picture.\r\n\r\nThe premise in \u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019 has more bounce to it than a basketball during the NBA playoffs and that is not necessarily a bad thing to note. While Hunt continues his mission to stop the team\u2019s latest despicable foe (Sean Harris) and end the operation of the insidious operation known as the Syndicate there are feathers being ruffled because of the federalised threats to shut down the IMF empire through the suggestion of a top-notch CIA director (Alec Baldwin). Naturally, IMF head honcho Brandt (Jeremy Renner) tries to prevent such hasty actions as his team of agents must overcome some of the controversy and confrontations from previous disastrous events that have warranted the threatening hints to shutdown his governmental outfit.\r\n\r\nCruise's Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn't know how long he'll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nCruise\u2019s Agent Ethan Hunt is leaving on a jet plane and doesn\u2019t know how long he\u2019ll be back again in the eye-popping actioner MISSION: IMPOSSIBLE-ROGUE NATION.\r\nOne cannot say enough about the ponderous yet action-packed \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 as this exceedingly spry and hyperactive spy caper keeps one on their anxious feet while never letting up for a gasp of air. The exotic locales, showy opera houses, heart-pounding action sequences, innovative chase scenes on wheels, over-the-top baddies, well-choreographed fist fights and, of course, Cruise\u2019s roguish Hunt and his willingness to soak up the mischievousness and mayhem of the proceedings allows this particular \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 installment to resonate so soundly in its off-kilter, energetic greatness. The supporting players such as Simon Pegg\u2019s Benji and Ving Rhames\u2019s Luther are on hand to contribute to the landscape of the triumphant cloak-and-dagger goings-on. In particular, Rebecca Ferguson is the transfixing tart whose presence as Cruise\u2019s enigmatic female lead is easily a scene stealer. Can she be trusted or not? Who cares? In the long run, Ferguson\u2019s inclusion is almost mandatory just to spice up this first-rate popcorn pleaser a tad bit more. Tom Hollander (\u2018In the Loop\u2019) adds some flavor in the mix as the unpredictable British Prime Minister.\r\n\r\nMcQuarrie (who worked with Cruise previously on \u2018Jack Reacher\u2019 and helmed \u2018The Way Of The Gun\u2019) had a tough act to follow in terms of trying to keep stride with prior \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 big names in auteurs Brian De Palma, John Woo, J.J. Abrams and Brad Bird. Indeed, that is a tall order to fill. However, as the Oscar-winner screenwriter for \u2018The Usual Suspects\u2019 McQuarrie has shown that his take on the fifth edition of the \u2018Mission: Impossible\u2019 film franchise with \u2018Rogue Nation\u2019 can easily be as defiant and defining as any of his predecessors\u2019 intense, eye-popping outings.\r\n\r\n\u2018Mission: Impossible-Rogue Nation\u2019, with its lavish set pieces and sophisticated sense of winding and grinding with the twitchy antics of Cruise leading the pack, is perhaps the closest thing to resembling the elegance and excellence of the indomitable Agent 007.\r\n\r\nMission: Impossible-Rogue Nation (2015)\r\n\r\nParamount Pictures\r\n\r\n2 hrs. 12 mins.\r\n\r\nStarring: Tom Cruise, Simon Pegg, Jeremy Renner, Ving Rhames, Sean Harris, Rebecca Ferguson, Tom Hollander, Simon McBurney and Zang Jingchu\r\n\r\nDirected and Written by: Christopher McQuarrie\r\n\r\nRating: PG-13\r\n\r\nGenre: Spy Thriller/Action-Adventure/Intrigue and Espionage\r\n\r\nCritic\u2019s Rating: *** 1/2 stars (out of 4 stars)","id":"56207f7092514171d4006ad6","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/56207f7092514171d4006ad6"},{"author":"Andres Gomez","content":"Everything you can expect from a \"Mission: Impossible\" movie. The script is not the brightest nor the freshest but works OK. Cruise, Pegg and Rhames keep the franchise afloat while Renner and Baldwin feel unneeded.\r\n\r\nGreat addition with Ferguson. She takes most of the attention in this movie.\r\n\r\nGood work from the direction.","id":"568244c6c3a36828f5008ff1","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/568244c6c3a36828f5008ff1"},{"author":"Gimly","content":"So after all that, I\u2019m pretty convinced that the _Mission: Impossible_ series just isn\u2019t for me. That being said, how many film franchises can say that their fifth instalment was also their best? Probably just this one, and, maybe _Fast & Furious_. There\u2019s actually a lot of parallels between those two lines of movies. \r\n\r\nPertaining specifically to _Mission: Impossible_ though, this one truly is the best of the bunch in my opinion. It has it\u2019s most complete female role to date, in fact, you could say that of any character. This is the first film that doesn\u2019t feel like it entirely hinges on Ethan Hunt\u2019s input. The characters surrounding him are actual people with their own personalities and ideas. And maybe it\u2019s just that I\u2019ve watched him do it five times in the past three days, but honestly I even sort of bought Tom Cruise in an action role this time around. \r\n\r\nCrazy.\r\n\r\n_Final rating:★★½ - Had a lot that appealed to me, didn\u2019t quite work as a whole._","id":"57b40f23c3a368184a001bd9","url":"https://www.themoviedb.org/review/57b40f23c3a368184a001bd9"}]
